# Decision Log

> Append-only, ADR-style rationale archive. Newest at the bottom. Never edit a past
> entry — supersede it with a new one and link both.
>
> **What belongs here.** Only a decision that establishes or changes a **standing
> constraint** — a choice future work must obey beyond the current item: a dependency or
> tool to use (or a ban on an alternative), a pattern code must follow, or an
> architectural boundary. Test: *would an agent building an unrelated future item need to
> know this?* If yes, it belongs here **and** as a one-line rule in `architecture.md`'s
> Rules section (the manager adds the rule). If it is local to one item (how a single
> function is shaped, a one-off value), it does **not** belong here — note it in
> `progress.md` instead. This bar keeps the log tight and guarantees every entry has a
> binding rule pointing back at it.
